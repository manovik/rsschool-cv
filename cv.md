I've started web developing at the end of 2019. My _goal_ is to become a professional **Front-end Developer**. I totally respect _high skilled_ and _intelligent_ people and it makes me scream inside when one of them shows me some _mind blowing_ things, skills or facts I couldn't imagine can be real.
I'm very curious person an always opened for new knowledge and abilities.

I don't use dictionary while speaking English, but need one sometimes.

### A little about my education

- **Belarussian University of Law -** (*2010 - 2015*) - Accountance, analisys and audition - _Bachelor economist_
- **IT Academy -** (*2019*) "Web-technologies Basics"
- **From 0 to 1 -** (*2020*) by [Vadim Prokopchuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadim-prokopchuk-a4725616a/)
- **Udemy -** Today I give all my spare time to learning **"JavaScript _and_ React"** course made by [Ivan Petrichenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-petrychenko/)

##### I've got skills at:
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- JavaScript (_React, Redux in the near future_).


##### Technologies I use: 
- BEM
- gulp
- sass/scss/less
- npm.

##### Graphics editors:
- Adobe Photoshop
- Figma
As they're all the same, I'm sure I can also use Avocode, Zeplin, Sketch, etc.

##### IDE's:
- VS Code (most of time)
- Sublime text


#### Experience and examples

Unfortunately there's only a couple landings made.
You can see them [here](https://manovik.github.io/show-horses) (_unexisting_ horse club) and [here](https://manovik.github.io/show-rest) (_unexisting_ restaurant). I haven't made any more landings or web pages since I decided to learn native JS and it's frameworks.

#### Languages

As I sad earlier, I have to use online dictionaries for translating some words, but I watch many native speakers from USA, Canada (English native of course) and England. Most of them are musicians, because I like to watch music producers at work.

Hope this CV will become bigger as soon as... soon.
