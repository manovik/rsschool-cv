I've started web developing at the end of 2019. My _goal_ is to become a professional **Front-end Developer**. I totally respect _high skilled_ and _intelligent_ people and it makes me scream inside when one of them shows me some _mind blowing_ things, skills or facts I couldn't imagine can be real.
I'm very curious person an always opened for new knowledge and abilities.

I don't use dictionary while speaking English, but need one sometimes.

#### Languages

As I sad earlier, I use online dictionaries for translating some words, but I watch many native speakers from USA, Canada and England. Most of them are musicians, because I like to watch music producers at work.
